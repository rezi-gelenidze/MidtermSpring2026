# Midterm UNO CLI

This is a standalone CLI UNO-like game.

The code is written as plausible feature-grown Java: almost everything lives in one procedural `Main` class. It works, but it has mixed responsibilities, duplicated rule logic, primitive-heavy card handling, global state, and condition-heavy gameplay code. The goal is to refactor it safely, not rewrite it.

## Compile

```bash
scripts/compile.sh
```

## Run Bot Games

```bash
scripts/run.sh --bots 3 --games 5 --quiet
```

## Run Interactive Game

```bash
scripts/run.sh --human --bots 2 --games 1
```

Card input examples:

```text
R5   red 5
YS   yellow skip
BR   blue reverse
G+2  green draw two
W    wild
W4   wild draw four
draw draw a card
```

## Characterization Checks

```bash
scripts/test.sh
```
